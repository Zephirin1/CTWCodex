# CTWCodex
 Stat grabber specifically focusing on Capture the Wool, which is a gamemode on the Hypixel Minecraft server. 

The purpose of this project is primarily to provide a statistic viewing web application for active players of the Capture the Wool gamemode on the Hypixel network. A secondary purpose of this project is for my own personal benefit, specifially for me to expand my knowledge of web development.

This project uses the Flask framework for the Python programming language in combination with publicly available information which is accessible through the Hypixel API. This is my first project doing anything involving web development or Flask, so bear with me as I learn how to effectively follow the process :)
